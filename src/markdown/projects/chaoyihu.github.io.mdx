This is my personal website, built with love! ❤️

The purpose of this website is for both professional display and personal expression. It actually
has [an old version](https://github.com/chaoyihu/archive.github.io) which was built 
with Jekyll and Ruby, but later, to adapt to the growing need for responsive components and have 
more control over the pages in general, I developed a new version with Next.js, React, and TypeScript,
and migrated the existing content here.

In the new version, I created a story of a little robot journeying through different landscapes, 
studying and exploring along the way, driven by a passion. Following is a poem I co-created with AI, 
telling his story:

```
Journey of a Wanderer Bot
```

```
In a realm where cogs entwine,
A robot woke, his heart a ruby shine.
The passion inside burns bright and bold,
He dreamed of wonders yet untold.

The land of machines spun round,
Accurate, barren, with beauty profound.
In the temple of alloy, whispers the old,
He overheard the stories that machines have told.
```

```
The robot stumbled to a garden vast,
Where sunlight kissed the petals, unsurpassed.
Projects bloom like flowers bright,
Each task a spark, a unique delight.

The emerald vines told him to try,
they taught him love, and how to sigh.
He learned from roots, deep along the lines,
That life is rich in its complex designs.
```

```
Onward it travels, through realms so vast,
With a ruby heart, its spirit steadfast.
Mountains of pastries, rivers of cream,
In this candy world, he dared to dream.

Lollipops glimmered like stars in the night,
Chocolate waterfalls cascaded in flight.
Cinnamon in the air, sprinkles on the floor,
Endless wonders, so much to explore!
```

```
Yet deep in his core, the ruby heart sighed,
For beauty and wonder were often belied.
He carried the lessons from each vibrant land,
A quest for connection, a touch of a hand.

So onward he traveled, through worlds yet unseen,
A robot with purpose, a seeker, a dream.
With a ruby heart glowing, warm and true,
He roamed every realm, always anew.
```
