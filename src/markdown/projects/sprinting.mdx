## Intro

Imagine you're grappling with inefficient team collaboration. Your team members lack a clear understanding of the goal, constantly getting bogged down by distractions and irrelevant tasks.

Enter Sprinting â€“ your solution to end the chaos and sharpen your team's focus. It works by defining clear goals, breaking the project into manageable tasks, and setting a timer to keep everyone on track.

With Sprinting, watch as your team transforms into a synchronized powerhouse. Every team member will function with great clarity and zero distractions, and move purposefully toward the shared objective.

## Highlights

- Designed and built a dynamic web application to streamline sprint planning, sprint events hosting and progress sharing among team members, leveraging Python with Tornado web framework for backend development, JavaScript for responsive frontend interfaces, and Redis for efficient data storage.
- Utilized Redis pub/sub for seamless team communication via instant messages.
- Deployed the application using Docker on Amazon EC2.


## Walkthrough

Here is the entrypoint to the application:

After registering or logging in, a profile page is presented. The left pane contains user information, and on the right pane, user can either initiate a new sprint or join an existing one using sprint id shared by the event initiator.

This is what the event planning stage look like, you can:
- Choose a descriptive title for the sprint event.
- Write an introduction, setting clear goals and introducing main methodology.
- Define specific tasks to be completed.
- Add, edit, or delete tasks.
- Set a timer for the event.

Initiating the sprint will redirect you to the main event page. Event info is shown on the left pane, including title, introduction, initiator and the event timer. Copy and share sprint id to invite other sprinters. The middle pane shows the task list and real-time standing of all sprinters. In the message pane on the right, sprinters can communicate each other via instant messaging.
