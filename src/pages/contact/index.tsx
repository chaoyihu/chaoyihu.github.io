            <p>Yet deep in his core, the ruby heart sighed,<br/>
                For beauty and wonder were often belied.<br/>
                He carried the lessons from each vibrant land,<br/>
                A quest for connection, a touch of a hand.</p>

                <p>So onward he traveled, through worlds yet unseen,<br/>
                A robot with purpose, a seeker, a dream.<br/>
                With a ruby heart glowing, warm and true,<br/>
                He roamed every realm, always anew.</p>
